Analysis scripts accompanying Stammnitz & Lehner, 2025

Maximilian Stammnitz, Lehner Laboratory, Centre for Genomic Regulation (2022â€“2025)

This repository contains custom R scripts which - in conjunction with the associated supplementary files - can be used to replicate the main and extended dta figures presented in: The genetic architecture of the allosteric plant hormone receptor PYL1 (Stammnitz & Lehner 2025, biorXiv).

The scripts are written to run on R version 3.6.3 or later. You should be able to check your current version of R by running the command below:

R --version

The current R version is also shown when opening RStudio or the R Console.

Scripts require the following R packages: readxl, stringr, scales, lubridate, data.table, Biostrings, GenomicRanges, ggplot2, ggmap, rstudioapi, ggsn, circlize, caper, phytools, treeio, ggtree, rectanglePacking

Although care has been taken to make the code distribution-independent, it is possible that some of the scripts only work on Unix/MacOS systems, and may need to be modified in order to run on Windows systems.
